## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE 
- **Graduate Research Assistant, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Houston, USA                                 (Aug. 2018 – May 2022)**
  - **Theoretical analysis**: Developed a new conceptual model for competition between vegetation and subsurface runoff  and a  functional relationship between water        balance and vegetation productivity
  - **Modeling**: Developed lumped/distributed water management modules for Xanthos, MOSART-sediment input datasets for the contiguous US
  - **Machine learning**: Developed a machine learning approach for predicting median bed sediment.

  - **Theoretical analysis**: Analyzed underlying hydrological process and mechanisms for hysteresis patterns emerging between catchment wetting and GPP, Early               developments of Horton index conceptual method and a supply-based vegetation water use efficiency at catchment scale
  - **Modeling**: Updated MOSART-water global flow directions for the Caspian Sea and Gulf of Mexico for use in the DOE E3SM coupled model, developed a procedure for  global reservoirs georeferencing and downstream dependent grid delineation
